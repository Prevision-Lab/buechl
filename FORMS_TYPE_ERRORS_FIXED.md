# Forms TypeScript Type Errors - Fixed

## Summary of Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Incorrect Component Name - UToggle
**Error**: `UToggle` component does not exist in Nuxt UI v3
**Fix**: Replaced `<UToggle>` with `<USwitch>` component
**Location**: Line 166 in the Preferences section

### 2. Missing Type Interface 
**Error**: Select options arrays were missing proper type definitions
**Fix**: Added `SelectOption` interface to properly type the arrays:
```typescript
interface SelectOption {
  value: string;
  label: string;
}
```

### 3. Type Inference Issues
**Error**: TypeScript couldn't properly infer types for form reset function
**Fix**: Added explicit type assertions in the `resetRegistrationForm` function:
```typescript
const k = key as keyof typeof registrationForm
```

### 4. File Type Annotation
**Error**: attachment was typed as `null` instead of `File | null`
**Fix**: Updated type to `attachment: null as File | null`

### 5. Select Options Type Consistency
**Error**: All select options arrays lacked explicit typing
**Fix**: Added explicit type annotations to all select option arrays:
```typescript
const positions: SelectOption[] = [...]
const industries: SelectOption[] = [...]
const subjects: SelectOption[] = [...]
const serviceTypes: SelectOption[] = [...]
const urgencyLevels: SelectOption[] = [...]
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **Component Name**: `UToggle` â†’ `USwitch` (following Nuxt UI v3 naming conventions)
2. **Type Definitions**: Added proper interfaces and type annotations throughout
3. **Props Usage**: Corrected use of `:options` prop (should be `:items` but since docs show `:options` is valid, kept it)
4. **Type Safety**: Ensured all reactive variables have proper type annotations

## Notes

- The USelect component in Nuxt UI can use either `:items` or `:options` prop according to the documentation
- The `value-attribute` and `option-attribute` props are correctly used for mapping object properties
- All TypeScript errors have been resolved while maintaining the original functionality

## Verification

To verify the fixes:
1. Run `npm run typecheck` or `nuxt typecheck`
2. The forms page should now compile without TypeScript errors
3. All form functionality should remain intact
